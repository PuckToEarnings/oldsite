The more content heavy your site the better the plugin will perform and the more you will see the improvements in performance. See <a href="http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/stresstest1000img.htm" rel="nofollow">this demo</a> of a page with 1,000 images (yes 1,000 images) to load.</p>
<p>a3 Lazy Load is inspired by and powered by the ressio <a href="https://github.com/ressio/lazy-load-xt" rel="nofollow">Lazy-Load-xt JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p>a3 Lazy Load is the most fully featured, incredibly easy to set up lazy load plugin for WordPress. Use the plugins admin settings to easily define what elements are lazy loaded and when they become visible in the users browser. As the user scrolls down the page the next lot of elements you have applied lazy Load to are only loaded as they become visible in the view port.</p>
<h4>IMAGE LAZY LOAD</h4>
<p>Images are the number one element that slows page load and increases bandwidth use. From the a3 Lazy Load admin panel turn load images by a3 Lazy Load ON | OFF. For more flexibility when ON you can choose to ON | OFF lazy load for images in</p>
<ul>
<li>Post, Pages and Custom Post Types (All Content areas)</li>

The WordPress embed method of copying and pasting the video url into posts and pages content area is fully supported.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> &#8211; Works with Videos added by Text and HTML Widgets but not the new WordPress Video widget. That widget does not pull iframe at first load, it use JavaScript to replace html to iframe and hence a3 lazy Load can&#8217;t see it to apply.</p>
<p>From the a3 lazy Load admin panel turn Video Support ON | OFF. When ON you can choose to ON | OFF lazy load for videos in</p>
<ul>
<li>Video embeded by URL in Post and Pages (All Content areas)</li>

<p>a3 Lazy Load allows you to easily exclude any image or video by class name from having the Lazy Load effect applied. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/#faq-header">See FAQ&#8217;s</a></p>

<p>a3 Lazy Load has built in Noscript fallback if user has JavaScript turned off in their browser. Developers who use underscore.js in their applications can use the Noscript parameter to exclude their plugins content from Lazy Load.</p>
<h4>THEME &amp; PLUGIN COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<p>a3 Lazy Load works with any WordPress theme that follows the WordPress Theme Codex. However, many Theme &amp; Plugin developers will use a custom written function to add objects, example the theme has a home page with layout created by a custom function they have written. a3 Lazy Load cannot know what these functions are and so cannot apply to the objects loaded by that custom function.</p>
<p>If your images or objects not being Lazy Loaded in a certain section of your site, but are Lazy Loaded everywhere else you will know this is the cause. Please if this happens raise a support ticket with the developer, explaining that they just need to add a simple tag to their custom functions so that a3 Lazy Load apply to their custom function and be fully compatible. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/#faq-header">Here is a list</a> of a3 lazy Load filter tags to include in your ticket to make it easy for the developer.</p>

<h4>How do I exclude individual objects from Lazy Load?</h4>
<p>
<p>Use this built in class name to exclude lazy load on individual images, videos and iframes.<br />
    a3-notlazy</p>
</p>
<h4>Why are some images, videos, objects not Lazy Loaded?</h4>
<p>
<p>a3 Lazy Load can only be applied to objects that are added using core WordPress functions. If your theme or a plugin developer adds objects such as images or videos via a custom written function, a3 lazy Load cannot know what that custom function is and hence cannot Lazy Load the object.</p>
<p>So if you see object not being lazy loaded please check first if those objects are loaded by the theme or a plugin. If they are, you can be confident that they are loaded by a custom function.</p>
<p>If this is the case, please help yourself and other a3 lazy Load users by raising a support ticket with the developer and ask them to add an a3 Lazy Load filter tag to their function to allow a3 Lazy Load to find it and apply to the object.</p>
<p>Below is a list of available a3 Lazy Load filters to use and pass onto the developer.</p>
</p>
<h4>Filter tags to apply lazy load</h4>
<p>
<p>Apply lazy load for images in content.<br />
    a3_lazy_load_images<br />
Example:<br />
    apply_filters( &#8216;a3_lazy_load_images&#8217;, $your_content, null );</p>
<p>Apply lazy load for videos and iframe from content.<br />
    a3_lazy_load_videos<br />
Example:<br />
    apply_filters( &#8216;a3_lazy_load_videos&#8217;, $your_content, null );</p>
<p>Apply lazy load for all images, videos and iframe from content<br />
    a3_lazy_load_html<br />
Example:<br />
    apply_filters( &#8216;a3_lazy_load_html&#8217;, $your_content, null );</p>
</p>
<h4>Filter Tags to Exclude by Theme Class name</h4>
<p>
<p>Filter tags to add to class name of theme to exclude lazy load on images or videos.<br />
    a3_lazy_load_skip_images_classes<br />
    a3_lazy_load_skip_videos_classes</p>

looking for broken links and let you know if any are found.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitors links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).</li>
<li>Detects links that don&#8217;t work, missing images and redirects.</li>
<li>Notifies you either via the Dashboard or by email.</li>
<li>Makes broken links display differently in posts (optional).</li>
<li>Prevents search engines from following broken links (optional).</li>
<li>You can search and filter links by URL, anchor text and so on.</li>
<li>Links can be edited directly from the plugin&#8217;s page, without manually updating each post.</li>
<li>Highly configurable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic Usage</strong></p>
<p>Once installed, the plugin will begin parsing your posts, bookmarks (AKA blogroll) and other content and looking for links. Depending on the size of your site this can take from a few minutes up to an hour or more. When parsing is complete, the plugin will start checking each link to see if it works. Again, how long this takes depends on how big your site is and how many links there are. You can monitor the progress and tweak various link checking options in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker</em>.</p>
<p>The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of the WP admin panel &#8211; <em>Tools -&gt; Broken Links</em>. A notification will also appear in the &#8220;Broken Link Checker&#8221; widget on the Dashboard. To save display space, you can keep the widget closed and configure it to expand automatically when problematic links are detected. E-mail notifications need to be enabled separately (in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker</em>).</p>
<p>The &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; tab will by default display a list of broken links that have been detected so far. However, you can use the links on that page to view redirects or see a listing of all links &#8211; working or not &#8211; instead. You can also create new link filters by performing a search and clicking the &#8220;Create Custom Filter&#8221; button. For example, this can be used to create a filter that only shows comment links.</p>
<p>There are several actions associated with each link. They show up when you move your mouse over to one of the links listed the aforementioned tab &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Edit URL&#8221; lets you change the URL of that link. If the link is present in more than one place (e.g. both in a post and in the blogroll), all occurrences of that URL will be changed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Unlink&#8221; removes the link but leaves the link text intact.</li>
<li>&#8220;Not broken&#8221; lets you manually mark a &#8220;broken&#8221; link as working. This is useful if you know it was incorrectly detected as broken due to a network glitch or a bug. The marked link will still be checked periodically, but the plugin won&#8217;t consider it broken unless it gets a new result.</li>
<li>&#8220;Dismiss&#8221; hides the link from the &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; and &#8220;Redirects&#8221; views. It will still be checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. a strike-through effect for broken links), but won&#8217;t be reported again unless its status changes. Useful if you want to acknowledge a link as broken/redirected and just leave as it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also click on the contents of the &#8220;Status&#8221; or &#8220;Link Text&#8221; columns to get more info about the status of each link.</p>

<li>The background worker thread that is started up via AJAX will now close the connection almost immediately after it starts running. This will reduce resource usage slightly. May also solve the rare and mysterious slowdown some users have experienced when activating the plugin.</li>
<li>Updated Italian translation</li>
<li>Fixed an unlocalized string on the &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; page</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.6.5</h4>

</ul>
<h4>0.6.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added French translation.</li>
<li>Updated Italian translation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.6.3</h4>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Added an Italian translation.</li>

<ul>
<li>Some translation-related fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initial localization support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.18</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added a workaround for auto-enclosures. The plugin should now parse the &#8220;enclosure&#8221; custom field correctly.</li>
<li>Let people use Enter and Esc as shortcuts for &#8220;Save URL&#8221; and &#8220;Cancel&#8221; (respectively) when editing a link.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.17</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added a redirect detection workaround for users that have safe&#095;mode or open&#095;basedir enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.16.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be more careful when parsing safe&#095;mode and open&#095;basedir settings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.16</h4>
<ul>
<li>Also try the upload directory when looking for places where to put the lockfile.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.15</h4>
<ul>
<li>Editing links with relative URLs via the plugin&#8217;s interface should now work properly. Previously the plugin would just fail silently and behave as if the link was edited, even if it wasn&#8217;t.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.14</h4>
<ul>
<li>Made the timeout value used when checking links user-configurable.</li>
<li>The plugin will now report an error instead of failing silently when it can&#8217;t create the necessary database tables.</li>

<li>Cleaned up some redundant/useless code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.13</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the bug where the plugin would ignore FORCE&#095;ADMIN&#095;SSL setting and always use plain HTTP for it&#8217;s forms and AJAX.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.12</h4>
<ul>
<li>Let the user set a custom temporary directory, if the default one is not accessible for some reason.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use absolute paths when loading includes. Apparently using the relative path could cause issues in some server configurations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.10.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a stupid typo</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Separated the user-side functions from the admin-side code so that the plugin only loads what&#8217;s required.</li>
<li>Changed some internal flags yet again.</li>
<li>Changed the algorithm for finding the server&#8217;s temp directory.</li>
<li>Fixed the URL extraction regexp again; turns out backreferences inside character classes don&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>Process shortcodes in URLs.</li>
<li>If the plugin can&#8217;t find a usable directory for temporary files, try wp-content.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t remove </li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>pre&gt; tags before parsing the post. Turns out they can actually contain valid links (oops).</p>
<h4>0.5.9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added an autogenerated changelog.</li>
<li>Added a workaround to make this plugin compatible with the SimplePress forum.</li>
<li>Fixed </li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>pre&gt; block parsing, again.<br />
* Fixed a bug where URLs that only differ in character case would be treated as equivalent.<br />
* Improved the database upgrade routine.</p>
<h4>0.5.8.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added partial proxy support when CURL is available. Proxies will be fully supported in a later version.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed links that are currently in the process of being checked showing up in the &#8220;Broken links&#8221; table.</li>
<li>The post parser no longer looks for links inside </li>
</ul>
<pre></pre>
<p>blocks.</p>
<h4>0.5.7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Slightly changed the dashboard widget&#8217;s layout/look as per a user&#8217;s request.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.6</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved relative URL parsing. The plugin now uses the permalink as the base URL when processing posts.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minor bugfixes</li>
<li>URLs with spaces (and some other special characters) are now handled better and won&#8217;t get marked as &#8220;broken&#8221; all the time.</li>
<li>Links that contain quote characters are parsed properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the uninstaller not deleting DB tables.</li>
<li>Other uninstallation logic fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved timeout detection/handling when using Snoopy.</li>
<li>Set the max download size to 5 KB when using Snoopy.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare bug where the settings page would redirect to the login screen when saving settings.</li>
<li>Removed some stale, unused code (some still remains).</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a SQL query that had the table prefix hard-coded as &#8220;wp&#095;&#8221;. This would previously make the plugin detect zero links on sites that have a different table prefix.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug when the plugin creates a DB table with the wrong prefix.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a near-complete rewrite with a lot of new features.</li>
<li>See �http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/05/22/broken-link-checker-05/ for details.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.14</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix false positives when the URL contains an #anchor</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.13</h4>
<ul>
<li>(Hopefully) fix join() failure when Snoopy doesn&#8217;t return any HTTP headers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.12</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>There are no release notes for this version</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set the Referer header to blog&#8217;s home address when checking a link. This should help deal with some bot traps.</li>
<li>I know, I know &#8211; there haven&#8217;t been any major updates for a while. But there will be eventually 🙂</li>
<li>Fix SQL error when a post is deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changed required access caps for &#8220;Manage -&gt; Broken Links&#8221; from manage&#095;options to edit&#095;ohers&#095;posts. This will allow editor users to access that page and it&#8217;s functions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Link sorting, somewhat experimental.</li>
<li>JavaScript sorting feature for the broken link list.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.4.8</h4>
<ul>
<li>CURL isn&#8217;t required anymore. Snoopy is used when CURL isn&#8217;t available.</li>
<li>Post title in broken link list is now a link to the post (permalink). Consequently, removed &#8220;View&#8221; button.</li>
<li>Added a &#8220;Details&#8221; link. Clicking it will show/hide more info about the reported link.</li>
<li>&#8220;Unlink&#8221; and &#8220;Edit&#8221; now work for images, too. &#8220;Unlink&#8221; simply removes the image.</li>
<li>Database modifications to enable the changes described above.</li>
<li>Moved the URL checking function from wsblc&#095;ajax.php to broken-link-checker.php; made it more flexible.</li>
<li>New and improved (TM) regexps for finding links and images.</li>
<li>A &#8220;Settings&#8221; link added to plugin&#8217;s action links.</li>
<li>And probably other stuff I forgot!</li>
<li>Grr 😛</li>

<h4>0.4.7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minor enhancements :</li>
<li>Autoselect link URL after the user clicks &#8220;Edit&#8221;.</li>

</ul>
<h4>0.4.6</h4>

</ul>
<h4>7.0.5: April 9, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) that automatically attempts to correct for improperly set timezones in the WordPress settings panel, server timezone settings and/or GA profile timezones. This should eliminate issues with timezones on Lite user accounts, as well as allow for more accurate date reporting.</li>
<li>New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) to allow for deauthentication of profiles set on websites whose profiles were migrated (for example from a staging site to a production site)</li>
<li>Tweak: Made clientID retrieval more efficient.</li>
<li>Fixed: Several translation/textdomain and typo fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed: Undefined $num in the overview report.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.4: March 7, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: We&#8217;ve added links to the pages listed in the top pages part of the Overview report to make it easier to see which page each title belongs to.</li>
<li>New: We&#8217;ve added the UA code to the account selector to make it easier to determine which property to use.</li>
<li>New: Better compatibility with IE11.</li>

<li>Fixed: We fixed an issue where get_current_screen might be undefined on some pages.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed an issue where some improperly configured servers might resolve symlinks that are not supposed to be resolved, leading to issues with loading asset files MonsterInsights uses.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.3: February 28, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: We added support for tracking download files that have a cache busting variable on the URL.</li>
<li>New: We added support for the new UserID mode used in our AMP addon.</li>
<li>Tweak: We fixed a bug with the notices class, and drastically cut back on the number of them.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed a bug with our Facebook Instant Articles addon that prevented some users from being tracked for downloads.</li>
<li>Fixed: We fixed a bug in the usage tracking for some types of installs.</li>
<li>Fixed: We&#8217;ve allowed the disabling of tracking for admininistrator role users on single sites.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.2: February 27, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Fixed a bug with the analytics.js output where a UA code wasn&#8217;t entered, the $reason variable could be undefined.</li>
<li>Fixed: Fixed an issue where a notice might not be dismissable and we&#8217;ve also removed several of them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.1: February 26, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Support for the updated version of MonsterInsights AMP plugin which switches from using a custom REST endpoint to using the now built in Google AMP ClientID synching feature. If you&#8217;re using the AMP addon, you&#8217;ll want to also update that addon as well.</li>
<li>New: The __gaTracker and disable tracking functions will always be defined, even when we&#8217;re not tracking users (for example if viewing a preview, or if a logged-in administrator) to allow sites to not have to worry about breakage when variable exist checking isn&#8217;t done. </li>
<li>New: We now output a notice in the console and output the GA code (though do not run it) when we&#8217;re not tracking someone. This makes it easier to verify the Google code is indeed outputting, and also makes it more clear as to why a particular user isn&#8217;t being tracked. Note, when testing Google Analytics code, always do it logged out, ideally in the private browsing/incognito mode of your web browser. We&#8217;re going to keep working on improving the frontend system to simplify it and add new features for both Lite and Pro users now that we&#8217;ve jettisoned ga.js support in MonsterInsights 7.0. You&#8217;ll see updates through the year that add new tracking features, particularly ones that we&#8217;re tweaking in order to expand and refine our built-in reporting.</li>
<li>New: We added a &#8220;have a MonsterInsights license&#8221; link on the settings panel, to make it clearer the procedure for the quick and easy upgrade from MonsterInsights Lite to MonsterInsights Pro.</li>
<li>Tweak: We removed the phrase referencing the dashboard (removed in MonsterInsights 7.0) from the permissions settings.</li>
<li>Fixed: Due to us forgetting to include our jQuery shim for disable() in the Lite, some users were unable to use the 10/25/50 expand feature on the reports page.</li>
<li>Fixed: An accidental use of the PHP function date instead of the one called time meant that some users were unable to see updated reporting data each day in the Lite version.</li>
<li>Fixed: In sitei() in the api-auth class, we used mb_strimwidth to trim the final string to 30 characters. While this is a great PHP function, not all servers have the mbstring (Multibyte String) PHP extension installed, from which all mb_* functions are provided, despite it being a &#8220;required&#8221; PHP extension to use WordPress core. This caused some servers to be unable to authenticate and thus get our amazing new reports (sad face). This usage has been replaced with a standard substr use, thus allowing for compatibility with all servers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.0: February 20, 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Completely revamped reports with a new UI.</li>
<li>New: Ability to oAuth at the network level, and have that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a subsite level).</li>
<li>New: Ability to enter a license key at the network level, and have that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a subsite level).</li>
<li>New: Completely new oAuth flow, that handles more errors and allows for future growth. Importantly, your existing sites will continue to track (the UA code is manually moved in the upgrade process), but you will need to re-authenticate (a quicker, and even easier process in 7.0) to enable our all new reporting area. New permissions requested to allow for significantly expanded reporting (and some upcoming reports).</li>
<li>New: Ability to see the site traffic graphs in both pageviews and sessions.</li>
<li>New: You can now choose between Last 30 days, Last 7 days, or any date range of your choosing if you&#8217;re a paid MonsterInsights user!</li>
<li>New: Compare site traffic to the previous period.</li>
<li>New: Completely revamped overview report. You&#8217;ll find lots of new data has been added. Also, all of that data changes as you use change the date ranges (a Pro exclusive feature).</li>
<li>New: A brand new eCommerce report for Pro users</li>
<li>New: A brand new Search Console/Queries report for paid MonsterInsights users. This allows you to see which terms you are ranking for on Google and how Google searches are driving your site traffic, along with clickthrough rates.</li>
<li>New: A brand new Publishers report for Plus level users allowing you to see breakdown of important site metrics.</li>
<li>New: A lot of behind the scenes work enabling more reports to be added in the future. Stay on the lookout as we start significantly expanding the breadth and depth of reporting this year.</li>
<li>New: A revised general settings panel which is significantly faster to load.</li>
<li>New: Significant performance improvements. We completely top-to-bottom audited MonsterInsights. It&#8217;s now 286% faster in the admin and 161% faster in the frontend.</li>
<li>New: Completely new internal notification handling has been implemented. This should make it clearer if you need to address anything, and if so make it less tedious to figure out exactly what.</li>
<li>Tweak: We&#8217;ve changed the verbage for what users see if they are logged in as a site administrator on the frontend to make it more clear MonsterInsights doesn&#8217;t track site administrators to prevent them from skewing their own Google Analytics data (particularly demographics data) and to encourage them to use the Incognito Mode/Private browsing mode of their web browser (or log out) if they want to view the Google Analytics code.</li>
<li>Tweak: The URL used for the measurement protocol calls has been updated per Google guidance.</li>
<li>Tweak: We&#8217;ve discovered some strings that weren&#8217;t translatable, and fixed that.</li>
<li>Tweak: Based on your feedback, we&#8217;ve clarified the titles and descriptions used in some of the settings to make it more clear as to what they do.</li>
<li>Tweak: When first adding a license key, in rare cases sometimes the addons permissions didn&#8217;t sync. While extremely rare, and while MonsterInsights would automatically fix itself within 6 hours, we&#8217;ve added a system that eliminates this from happening, and made sure that there&#8217;s also a way to fix this manually if this need arises.</li>
<li>Tweak: The countries map has been changed to a countries list (sorted). This means we can remove jVectorMap which had some issues in mapping, and also make it easier for you to see your top countries data.</li>
<li>Removed: Support for the long deprecated ga.js tracking has been removed. We&#8217;ve had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now, and it&#8217;s time to remove support for these finally. Analytics.js tracking is far more accurate than ga.js tracking. Users of ga.js were not able to take advantage of new MonsterInsights features and Google Analytics features that relied on analytics.js, including our out-of-the-box Javascript based events tracking system, and many other features (like enhanced eCommerce tracking in our eCommerce addon). Google themselves deprecated ga.js over 5 years ago. On update, we&#8217;ll automatically move those using ga.js to analytics.js. This switch requires no changes on behalf of the site owner.</li>
<li>Removed: Support for the long deprecated PHP events tracking has been removed. We&#8217;ve had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now offering a 1 click update. The PHP events tracking, a stayover from the Yoast years, caused a lot of issues and couldn&#8217;t track everything on a page. It could only track things in specific WordPress areas like the_content and widgets, but couldn&#8217;t track anything outside of that, or things that were added to the DOM after WordPress rendered the page. Our JS events tracking system can track all-the-things on all parts of a page, and is far more accurate and easier for us to maintain. Maintaining a gigantic PHP regex-based system took a lot of our development time up, and based on our opt-in tracking data, almost no one uses it anymore (which is good, because JS tracking is so much better). Users still using it will be automatically switched to JS events tracking on update (which requires no changes to switch to using it).</li>
<li>Removed: Many deprecated filters from the Yoast era have been removed. After maintaining backwards compatibility for over a year now, and also issuing a notice every time those deprecated filters were used, it&#8217;s time to pull the plug on these to allow our tracking system to be able to be simplified in the future. We have a complete document in our documentation for the 6.0 release that details exactly how to update for each of these filters.</li>

<ul>
<li>Notice: Version numbers 6.0.5 &#8211; 6.0.10 were not used, as we&#8217;re synching the version numbers of the Lite and Pro versions of our plugin. You didn&#8217;t miss any updates.</li>
<li>Notice: As of this release, we no longer backport changes to the old <code>yst_ga</code> option. If you need to access MonsterInsights&#8217;s settings programically, please use our helper functions. Do not directly access a option.</li>
<li>New: Redesigned authentication dropdown that shows the site urls to make it easier to find a profile when the users have many accounts.</li>
<li>New: Tracking is now enabled for the WordPress admin login page (wp-login.php).</li>
<li>Tweak: The Google class in the admin now only checks for blocking when the reauth is attempted. Expect to save a ton of external calls in the admin, and maybe a performance boost.</li>
<li>Tweak: The GA client object is now lazyloaded on the frontend, so it&#8217;s loaded only when something (like another plugin) attempts to use it. In plain English, this will make a alot of sites load times significantly improve.</li>
<li>Tweak: The analytics.js output has been tweaked to be slightly more asthetically pleasing (its aligned correctly). We realize no one probably cares but we look at this code for every user we support, so it help us. </li>
<li>Tweak: The config expired notice has been updated to reflect that it can also be shown if the server is blocking MonsterInsights&#8217;s ability to connect to Google Analytics.</li>
<li>Tweak: The cron jobs for opt-in tracking and statistics have been combined into a single cron.</li>
<li>Tweak: Various performance improvements in the frontend output class.</li>
<li>Tweak: A notice is now shown when MonsterInsights rejects a manual UA code from being saved for being an invalid format.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the plugin TweetShare would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the manual UA code might not be ported as we were backporting changes to the monsterinsights_settings option to the yst_ga option for backwards compatibility. This lead to a situation where the new settings would override the old ones before the routine to fix the manual UA code issue had run.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where a fatal error from a reference to a class called &#8220;Yoast_Frontend_GA&#8221; which our plugin doesn&#8217;t have or use, would be shown caused by the previous Yoast usage of object caching via an autoloader. This is solved by doing a 1 time object cache flush on upgrade.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where if you had more than 1000 profiles on your Google account, not all would be shown.</li>
<li>Fixed: App analytics properties are now excluded from the dropdown of properties you can authenticate to.</li>
<li>Fixed: The readme suggested a filter to use for filtering the UA to use, but the filter name was typo&#8217;d. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the tracking cron would add a new unique cron each day.</li>
<li>Fixed: We implemented a routine to cleanup those extra crons as well as the old yoast one we no longer use.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where the .org theme Schema would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue where JS based events tracking might not correctly track a mailto: link.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.4, February 20, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweak: monsterinsights_delete_options now checks to ensure an array is passed in</li>
<li>Tweak: The reporting class now has many more object property checks.</li>
<li>Fixed: In install if WP version not supported or if MI Pro was active, the plugin attempted to call a property of the plugin object which didn&#8217;t exist.</li>
<li>Fixed: In the deactivate/uninstall routines, MI attempted to use a method of a class object which might not exist, as it might not be the active instance. Better instance handling has been added as well as many more exists checks have been added througought the plugin.</li>
<li>Fixed: Conflicting loads when both MI Pro and Lite are installed. Note, you should only have Pro installed if you want to use it. That being said, we&#8217;ve done extensive testing to ensure we&#8217;ve handled all of the edge cases surrounding this. This could also lead to issues where it would be impossible to remove Lite and/or Pro from a site if both were installed.</li>
<li>Fixed: Conflicts with the Pinnacle theme, which loads it&#8217;s CSS file (with overrides to literally all select2 inputs not just the ones it adds) across the entire admin. This lead to an issue where in the Google Auth, a user might not have been able to see (or could appear with wacky styling) the dropdown of profiles to select. If you cannot see this dropdown after authenticating, let us know as its most likely a simple plugin or theme conflict on CSS styling.</li>
<li>Fixed: The notices to deactivate/uninstall MI Lite/Pro when the other one were installed had an errant extra quotation mark, and they&#8217;re now more specific about the action to take.</li>
<li>Fixed: For some users, the setting for user role exclusion was not working. This has been corrected.</li>
<li>Fixed: A redirect issue that was looping for some users. The code that does this, while working for most, doesn&#8217;t for some. We&#8217;ve removed it until a full investigation can be completed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.3, February 20, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Path for fontawesome font files was incorrect</li>
<li>Fixed: Notice in the install routine for the $version variable not being set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.2, February 19, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Upgrade routine could drop manual UA codes in certain cases. If you upgraded to 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 and it lost the manual UA code, installing this update will automatically restore the UA code entered as long as you haven&#8217;t used the oAuth or re-entered the manual UA code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.1, February 19, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Typo that caused an issue with PHP 7 installs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.0.0, February 18, 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Completely overhauled design, from top to bottom. The plugin has been completely rewritten.</li>
<li>New: <strong>no more advertisements</strong> in the settings pages. We hated them too.</li>
<li>New: Javascript based event tracking</li>
<li>New: ga.js is now officially deprecated. New users cannot use it anymore, and existing users can only switch to analytics.js (but not back). Please note, all new features will be developed exclusively for analytics.js. Google has deprecated it, and now we&#8217;re deprecating our support for it.</li>
<li>New: License key system now uses the MonsterInsights License management system</li>
<li>New: Ability to pick which roles can access the dashboard/reports &amp; settings/addons/tools page using our UI. There&#8217;s also a new custom capability for this (a meta capability)</li>
<li>New: Support for Google Analytics Master accounts. When you oAuth into MonsterInsights now, the UA view is now locked to what you picked using the brand new oAuth procedure.</li>
<li>New: Revamped dashboard</li>
<li>New: Completely new settings system, with a completely new settings page, and a completely new settings API. Also some new hooks and tabs in preparation for the many addons we&#8217;ll be releasing over the next few months.</li>
<li>New: No more conflicts between the base plugins</li>
<li>New: Completely overhauled translation experience. The lite version translations are now fully managed through translations.wordpress.org.</li>
<li>New: Opt-in to anonymous data so we can better improve MonsterInsights</li>
<li>New: Significantly better addons page</li>
<li>New: Single license key to manage all MonsterInsights extensions.</li>
<li>New: Automatic detection of blocked asset files (from things like un-whitelisted uBlock Origin) with step by step directions on how to easily correct.</li>
<li>Tweak: Completely overhauled the ga.js and analytics.js outputs to fix outstanding bugs.</li>
<li>Tweak: Better debugging + disabled + preview tracking modes, that more clearly indicate what&#8217;s going on </li>
<li>Tweak: Completely overhauled PHP regex tracking to solve nearly a dozen outstanding bugs including issues where non-link elements starting with the letter &#8220;a&#8221; such as  tags would get parsed as links causing issues. Also solves issues related to single versus double quote usage for existing onclick handles, non-semicolon terminating onclick handles and various other parsing issues.</li>
<li>Tweak: Many previously untranslatable strings are now translatable.</li>
<li>Tweak: Minified in-plugin images.</li>
<li>Tweak: Minified admin css and js</li>
<li>Tweak: Uses latest version of Google PHP API now.</li>
<li>Tweak: The system for creating reports and getting Google Analytics reports have changed. If you&#8217;ve hardcoded into Yoast functions previously not designed for frontend output this could cause problems. We&#8217;ll introduce an API intended for this type of use after we update to use the v4 reporting API.</li>
<li>Fixed: Fixed an issue with HostEurope and other hosts modifying the default PHP arg seperator.</li>
<li>Fixed: Prevents an issue where users with a plugin like Airplane Mode active will get a better error message than &#8220;code invalid&#8221; on the GA token auth screen (and also fixes how that detection is done in other parts of the plugin). </li>
<li>Removed: unused track_full_url setting</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.5.3, October 3rd, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Announces MI 6.0 beta.</li>

<h4>5.5.2, July 7, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tweak: Updates license manager to have more reliable update information including better compatibility with Yoast SEO products.</li>
<li>Fixed: Compatibility with upcoming Shiny Updates v2 in WP core</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.5.0, May 1, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Added new System Info tab for faster support.</li>

<ul>
<li>New: Font based dashboard icon</li>
<li>Tweak: The &#8220;MonsterInsights&#8221; menu item name has been renamed to just &#8220;Insights&#8221;</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue with eCommerce addon (also requires user to update eCommerce addon)</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue with 2 dashboard links</li>
<li>Fixed: A bug in pre-existing code caused the menu of the plugin to skyrocket unintentionally. This has been corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.4.8, April 14, 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li>New: Google Analytics by Yoast is now MonsterInsights.</li>
<li>Fixed: Compatibility issue with WordPress 4.5</li>

";s:3:"faq";s:3693:"
<h4>Why are my photo galleries not opening up in a lightbox after I move my site?</h4>
<p>
<p>This is often due to the URL paths to the CSS and JavaScript files used by the Lightbox Effects not being changed to relevant addresses based on the new site. This article will help sort out this issue if that is the case: <a href="https://www.imagely.com/docs/galleries-opening-lightbox/" rel="nofollow">Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox?</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Do you have documentation or tutorials?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes. See <a href="https://www.imagely.com/docs/nextgen-gallery/" rel="nofollow">NextGEN Gallery Documentation</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Will this gallery plugin work with my theme?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yup, NextGEN is a popular and well-established WordPress gallery plugin, and has been for a long time. It will work well with most other themes and plugins in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>

<h4>Are the photo galleries flash based?</h4>
<p>
<p>Nope, we use no flash elements.</p>
</p>
<h4>Are the galleries mobile friendly?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve put a lot of work into this and, NextGEN Galleries are compatible with Android, iOS. All photo galleries are also responsive, so galleries look good on diverse screen sizes. NextGEN Pro also includes a full screen, responsive Pro Lightbox with mobile gesture support. It&#8217;s great for viewing photos on mobile devices.</p>
</p>
<h4>What is the difference between a gallery and an album?</h4>
<p>
<p>In simple terms, Albums are collections of galleries. So Galleries contain your photos and Albums contain your Galleries. Albums act as links and placeholders to quickly and easily navigate your galleries. Galleries will actually display your images.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I upload multiple images at once?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, you can batch upload entire photo galleries at one time.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I password protect galleries?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, WordPress allows you to password protect pages by default &#8211; which includes all photo galleries and content for the entire page. Password protection of pages can be turned on and off at any time, with just a few clicks.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I add a watermark to the my photos?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, you can add text or image watermarks to your gallery images.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I crop photo thumbnails?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, each thumbnail image can be individually adjusted to suit your needs.</p>
</p>
<h4>Is there pagination for photo galleries?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, you can use pagination when displaying thumbnail galleries. And you can adjust the amount of photos to be shown on a page at any time.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I customize the lightbox?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, the lightbox can be configured with multiple options directly from the Dashboard, and there are multiple CSS styles which can be applied and modified as well. If you want even more options, consider upgrading to NextGEN Pro and useing the NextGEN Pro lightbox.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I add HTML to photo captions?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, caption areas are fully HMTL capable.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I add an external links to galleries?</h4>
<p>
<p>Since the captions are fully HTML capable, you can add external links and any other type of mark up you wish.</p>
</p>
<h4>Is NextGEN Gallery available in foreign languages?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes, our WordPress gallery plugin has been translated into dozens of languages &#8211; <a href="https://www.imagely.com/languages/" rel="nofollow">click here to find out more.</a></p>

intended to work with other plugins. It is originally created for <a href="https://contactform7.com/" rel="nofollow">Contact Form 7</a>, however, you can use it with your own plugin.</p>
<p>Note: This product is &#8220;really simple&#8221; as its name suggests, i.e., it is not strongly secure. If you need perfect security, you should try other solutions.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>Really Simple CAPTCHA does not use PHP &#8220;Sessions&#8221; for storing states, unlike many other PHP CAPTCHA solutions, but stores them as temporary files. This allows you to embed it into WordPress without worrying about conflicts.</p>
<p>When you generate a CAPTCHA, Really Simple CAPTCHA creates two files for it; one is an image file of CAPTCHA, and the other is a text file which stores the correct answer to the CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>The two files have the same (random) prefix in their file names, for example, &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.png&#8221; and &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.txt.&#8221; In this case, for example, when the respondent answers &#8220;K5GF&#8221; as an answer to the &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.png&#8221; image, then Really Simple CAPTCHA calculates hash of &#8220;K5GF&#8221; and tests it against the hash stored in the &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.txt&#8221; file. If the two match, the answer is confirmed as correct.</p>
<h4>How to use with your plugin</h4>
<p>Note: Below are instructions for plugin developers.</p>
<p>First, create an instance of ReallySimpleCaptcha class:</p>
<pre><code>$captcha_instance = new ReallySimpleCaptcha();
</code></pre>
<p>You can change the instance variables as you wish.</p>
<pre><code>// Change the background color of CAPTCHA image to black
$captcha_instance-&gt;bg = array( 0, 0, 0 );
</code></pre>
<p>See really-simple-captcha.php if you are interested in other variables.</p>
<p>Generate a random word for CAPTCHA.</p>
<pre><code>$word = $captcha_instance-&gt;generate_random_word();
</code></pre>
<p>Generate an image file and a corresponding text file in the temporary directory.</p>
<pre><code>$prefix = mt_rand();
$captcha_instance-&gt;generate_image( $prefix, $word );
</code></pre>
<p>Then, show the image and get an answer from respondent.</p>
<p>Check the correctness of the answer.</p>
<pre><code>$correct = $captcha_instance-&gt;check( $prefix, $the_answer_from_respondent );
</code></pre>
<p>If the $correct is true, go ahead. Otherwise, block the respondent &#8212; as it would appear not to be human.</p>
<p>And last, remove the temporary image and text files, as they are no longer in use.</p>
<pre><code>$captcha_instance-&gt;remove( $prefix );
</code></pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>If you wish to see a live sample of this, you can try <a href="https://contactform7.com/captcha/" rel="nofollow">Contact Form 7</a>.</p>
";s:12:"installation";s:416:"<p>In most cases you can install automatically from WordPress.</p>
<p>However, if you install this manually, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the entire <code>really-simple-captcha</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>

<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<p>In most cases you can install automatically from WordPress.</p>
<p>However, if you install this manually, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the entire <code>really-simple-captcha</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>
</ol>
<p>FYI: There is no &#8220;control panel&#8221; for this plugin.</p>
</p>
<h4>CAPTCHA does not work; the image does not show up.</h4>
<p>
<p>Really Simple CAPTCHA needs GD and FreeType library installed on your server. Ask your server administrator if they are installed.</p>
<p>Also, make the temporary file folder writable. The location of the temporary file folder is managed by the instance variable <code>tmp_dir</code> of ReallySimpleCaptcha class. Note that the setting varies depending on the calling plugin. For example, Contact Form 7 uses <code>wp-contents/uploads/wpcf7_captcha</code> as the temporary folder basically, but it can use different folder depending on your settings.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please submit them <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/really-simple-captcha" rel="nofollow">to the support forum</a>.</p>

<p>This is useful for situations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new thumbnail size has been added and you want past uploads to have a thumbnail in that size.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve changed the dimensions of an existing thumbnail size, for example via Settings → Media.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve switched to a new WordPress theme that uses featured images of a different size.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also offers the ability to delete old, unused thumbnails as well as update the content of posts to use the new thumbnail sizes.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p><strong>WP-CLI</strong></p>
<p>If you have command line access to your server, I highly recommend using <a href="https://wp-cli.org/" rel="nofollow">WP-CLI</a> instead of this plugin as it&#8217;s faster (no HTTP requests overhead) and can be run inside of a <code>screen</code> for those with many thumbnails. For details, see the documentation of its <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/" rel="nofollow"><code>media regenerate</code> command</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Jetpack&#8217;s Photon Module</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/" rel="nofollow">Jetpack</a> is a plugin by Automattic, makers of WordPress.com. It gives your self-hosted WordPress site some of the functionality that is available to WordPress.com-hosted sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/support/photon/" rel="nofollow">The Photon module</a> makes the images on your site be served from WordPress.com&#8217;s global content delivery network (CDN) which should speed up the loading of images. Importantly though it can create thumbnails on the fly which means you&#8217;ll never need to use this plugin.</p>
<p>I personally use Photon on my own website.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Automattic but I would recommend Photon even if I didn&#8217;t.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix slowdown in certain cases in the media library.</li>
<li>Fix not being able to regenerate existing thumbnails for single images. Props @idofri.</li>
<li>Fix JavaScript error that could occur if the REST API response was unexpected (empty or PHP error).</li>
<li>Fix bug related to multibyte filenames.</li>
<li>If an image is used as the featured image on multiple posts, only regenerate it once instead of once per post.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 3.0.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily disable the update post functionality. I tested it a lot but it seems there&#8217;s still some bugs.</li>
<li>Temporarily disable the delete old thumbnails functionality. It seems to work fine but without the update post functionality, it&#8217;s not as useful.</li>
<li>Try to more gracefully handle cases where there&#8217;s missing metadata for attachments.</li>
<li>Wait until <code>init</code> to initialize the plugin so themes can filter the plugin&#8217;s capability. <code>plugins_loaded</code> is too early.</li>
<li>Fix a JavaScript error that would cause the whole regeneration process to stop if an individual image returned non-JSON, such as a 500 error code.</li>
<li>Accept GET requests for the regenerate REST API endpoint instead of just POSTs. For some reasons some people&#8217;s sites are using GET despite the code saying use POST.</li>
<li>Make the attachment ID clickable in error messages.</li>
<li>Fetch 25 attachments at a time instead of 5. I was using 5 for testing.</li>
<li>PHP notice fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 3.0.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Complete rewrite from scratch using Vue.js and the WordPress REST API.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.2.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Better AJAX response error handling in the JavaScript. This should fix a long-standing bug in this plugin. Props Hew Sutton.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.2.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make the capability required to use this plugin filterable so themes and other plugins can change it. Props <a href="http://jacksonwhelan.com/" rel="nofollow">Jackson Whelan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.2.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t check the nonce until we&#8217;re sure that the action called was for this plugin. Fixes lots of &#8220;Are you sure you want to do this?&#8221; error messages.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.2.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix the bottom bulk action dropdown. Thanks Stefan for pointing out the issue!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.2.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the Bulk Action functionality were made shortly before the release of WordPress 3.1 which broke the way I implemented the specific multiple image regeneration feature. This version adds to the Bulk Action menu using Javascript as that&#8217;s the only way to do it currently.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.1.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Move the <code>error_reporting()</code> call in the AJAX handler to the beginning so that we&#8217;re more sure that no PHP errors are outputted. Some hosts disable usage of <code>set_time_limit()</code> and calling it was causing a PHP warning to be outputted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.1.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>When regenerating all images, newest images are done first rather than the oldest.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with regeneration error reporting in some browsers. Thanks to pete-sch for reporting the error.</li>
<li>Supress PHP errors in the AJAX handler to avoid sending an invalid JSON response. Thanks to pete-sch for reporting the error.</li>
<li>Better and more detailed error reporting for when <code>wp_generate_attachment_metadata()</code> fails.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.1.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clean up the wording a bit to better match the new features and just be easier to understand.</li>
<li>Updated screenshots.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.1.0</h4>
<p>Lots of new features!</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to a lot of jQuery help from <a href="http://borisschapira.com/" rel="nofollow">Boris Schapira</a>, a failed image regeneration will no longer stop the whole process.</li>
<li>The results of each image regeneration is now outputted. You can easily see which images were successfully regenerated and which failed. Was inspired by a concept by Boris.</li>
<li>There is now a button on the regeneration page that will allow you to abort resizing images for any reason. Based on code by Boris.</li>
<li>You can now regenerate single images from the Media page. The link to do so will show up in the actions list when you hover over the row.</li>
<li>You can now bulk regenerate multiple from the Media page. Check the boxes and then select &#8220;Regenerate Thumbnails&#8221; form the &#8220;Bulk Actions&#8221; dropdown. WordPress 3.1+ only.</li>
<li>The total time that the regeneration process took is now displayed in the final status message.</li>
<li>jQuery UI Progressbar version upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.0.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Switch out deprecated function call.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.0.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Directly query the database to only fetch what the plugin needs (the attachment ID). This will reduce the memory required as it&#8217;s not storing the whole row for each attachment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.0.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>I accidentally left a <code>check_admin_referer()</code> (nonce check) commented out.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 2.0.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recoded from scratch. Now uses an AJAX request per attachment to do the resizing. No more PHP maximum execution time errors or anything like that. Also features a pretty progress bar to let the user know how it&#8217;s going.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.1.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>WordPress 2.7 updates &#8212; code + UI. Thanks to jdub and Patrick F.</li>

<p>Shariff enables website users to share their favorite content without compromising their privacy.</p>
<p>Facebook, Google+ and Twitter supply official sharing code snippets which quietly siphon personal data from all page visitors. Shariff enables visitors to see how popular your page is on Facebook and share your content with others without needless data leaks.</p>
<p>Shariff <code>(/ˈʃɛɹɪf/)</code> is an open-source, low-maintenance, high-privacy solution maintained by German computer magazine c&#8217;t and heise online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shariff supports sharing buttons for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, StumbleUpon, XING, WhatsApp and mail.<br />
Select which color you want, set the button location, select the orientation fitting most to your website and set the TTL just as you want.</p>

<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the <code>shariff-wp</code> directory to <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code></li>
<li>Activate the plugin through th ‚Plugins‘ menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Modify the settings as you want through Settings -&gt; Shariff</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>How do I hide Shariff on a page?</h4>
<p>
<p><strong>Method A:</strong> Edit the article and check <code>Deactivate Shariff?</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Method B:</strong> Include <code>hideshariff</code> in the article. The word will be removed automatically and Shariff will not be shown. If you want to write hidesharrif in an article without removing Shariff, just write <code>/hideshariff</code>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Shariff doesn&#8217;t show any numbers</h4>
<p>
<p>Your user probably doesn&#8217;t have the right to write to the default temp folder <code>/tmp</code>. Then create a new folder and use it as temp folder in the Shariff settings, make sure that the rights are set correct.</p>

They do not need to click on a share button for this and therefore have no choice, if they want their data to be send. The German computer magazine c&#8217;t has developed &#8220;Shariff&#8221; <code>(ʃɛɹɪf)</code> that follows the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR &#8211; Regulation (EU) 2016/679). This plugin adapts the Shariff concept and provides an easy to use solution for WordPress. We currently support 32 services in 25 languages: AddThis, Bitcoin, Diaspora, Facebook, Flattr, Flipboard, GooglePlus, LinkedIn, mailto, Mastodon, Odnoklassniki, Patreon, PayPal, PayPal.me, Pinterest, Pocket, Printer, Qzone, Reddit, RSS, SMS, Stumbleupon, Telegram, TencentWeibo, Threema, Tumblr, Twitter, VK, Wallabag, Weibo, WhatsApp, Xing.</p>

<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Upload everything to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin using the plugins menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Use <code>[shariff]</code> anywhere on your site and/or use the Shariff settings menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>To enable it for all posts please check the options in the plugin settings.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I use the Shariff buttons in my theme?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. Simply use the shortcode function <code>do_shortcode('[shariff]')</code>.<br />
You can use all options of the shorttag as described on the help tab in the plugin settings.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I use the total amount of shares in my theme?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. You can use <code>do_shortcode('[shariff services="totalnumber"]')</code> to simply output the total amount of shares for a post in the loop. It will return the number itself wrapped in a <code>&lt;span class="shariff-totalnumber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> in order for the shariff.js to update the count. Also only cached data is used, in order to not slow down your site.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Is there an action hook to use the share counts every time they get updated?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. You can use<br />
    function your_awesome_function( $share_counts ) {<br />
       // $share_counts is an array including all enabled services, the timestamp of the update and the url of the post.<br />
       // do stuff<br />
    }<br />
    add_action( &#8216;shariff_share_counts&#8217;, &#8216;your_awesome_function&#8217; );<br />
WARNING: This hook will get called A LOT. So be sure you know what you are doing.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I configure the widget?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: It uses the same options that have been configured on the plugin options page. However, you can put in a shorttag that overwrites the default options. It has the same format as you use in posts. Take a look at the help section of the plugin options page for more information.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I change the options on a single post?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes. You can change all options using the shorttag in the Shariff meta box on the right side of the post edit screen.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Why are shares not listed?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Shariff tries to protect the privacy of your visitors. In order to do this, the statistics have to be requested by your server, so social networks only see a request of your server and not from your visitor. However, we do not know, if you want this. Therefore it is not enabled by default.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I show the share counts?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Enable it on the plugin options page in general or add <code>backend="on"</code> to the shariff shorttag in your post.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I still do not see share counts</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Please have a look at the status tab on the plugin options page. It states whether share counts are enabled and if there is a problem with a service. Please also keep in mind that the plugin has a minimum refresh time of 60 seconds and that each service has their own cache as well.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Why can&#8217;t I change the TTL to a smaller / bigger value?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: The time to live (TTL) value determines, if a share count of a post or page gets refreshed when someone visits this specific page / post of your blog. Too small values create too much useless traffic, too high values negate the goal of motivating visitors to also share a post. The value can be adjusted between 60 and 7200 seconds. Keep in mind, the actual lifespan depends on the age of the post as well.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I get the Facebook API error message &#8220;request limit reached&#8221;!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Facebook has a rate limit of 600 requests per 600 seconds per IP address. Especially in shared hosting environments many domains share the same IP address and therefore the same limit. To avoid this you can try to raise the TTL value or provide a Facebook App ID and Secret. Google &#8220;facebook app id secret&#8221; will provide many guides on how to get these.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I change the position of all buttons?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Have a look at the alignment options in the admin menu or checkout the<br />
style option.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I change the design?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Have a look at the parameters &#8220;theme&#8221;, &#8220;orientation&#8221; and &#8220;buttonsize&#8221;. They work mostly like the original code parameters that are explained at http://heiseonline.github.io/shariff/ Or you can have a look at the test page at http://shariff.3uu.net/shariff-sample-page-with-all-options to get an<br />
overview. But please be warned: This is a test page! It is possible that you find features that are only provided in the development version. Use it only to get an impression of the design options.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I change the design of a single button?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: If you are a CSS guru please feel free to modify the css file. But of course this is a bad idea, because all changes will be destroyed with the next update! Instead take a look at the style and class attribute of the shorttag. If you put in any value it will create a DIV container with the ID &#8220;ShariffSC&#8221; around the buttons. If you are really a CSS guru you will know what does the magic from here on out. 😉</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I want the buttons to stay fixed while scrolling!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: No problem. Just use the style attribute to add some CSS to the shorttag. For example in a widget (adjust the width as needed):<br />
    [shariff style=&#8221;position:fixed;width:250px&#8221;]<br />
Of course you can use all other options in that shorttag as well. It also works with the CSS style option on the plugins design options page, if you really want this applied to all buttons on your page.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I want a horizontal line above my Shariff buttons!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: You can use the headline option on the design tab. For example, enter the following code to create a horizontal line and a headline:</p>
<p>Please share this post:</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: I want a different or no headline in a single widget, post or page!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Use the headline attribute to add or remove it. For example, you can use the following shorttag to remove a headline set on the plugins options page in a single widget:<br />
    [shariff headline=&#8221;&#8221;]<br />
Of course you can use all other options in that shorttag as well.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I add [shariff] on all posts?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes, check out the plugin options.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: But I want to hide it on a single post!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Do you really know what you want? 😉 However, it is possible. Write anywhere in your post &#8220;hideshariff&#8221;. It will be removed and Shariff will not be added. You can also use &#8220;/hideshariff&#8221; to write &#8220;hideshariff&#8221; in your post. You might also want to take a look at the Shariff meta box on the right side of your post edit screen.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What are the differences between the two Shariff plugins?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: One is developed by us, one by someone else. 😉 The main difference is that this plugin has a few more options and a great support. 🙂 Neither of the plugins are &#8220;official&#8221; or directly developed by Heise.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Does it work with a CDN?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Pinterest does not show an image!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: You can add media=&#8221;http://wwww.example.com/yourImage.png&#8221;<br />
within the [shariff] shorttag or add it in on the plugin options page &#8211; of course with the link to your image.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: Can I set a fixed URL to share?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: You can use the &#8220;url&#8221; parameter within the shortcode<br />
    [shariff url=&#8221;http://www.example.com/&#8221;]<br />
This is also available within widgets. However, it is not a good idea to manipulate the URI, because it could mislead your visitors. So you should only use it, if this is really needed and you do really know what you are doing. Therefore it is not available on the plugin options page in general.</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What happened to the Twitter share counts and what is OpenShareCount?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Please read: https://www.jplambeck.de/twitter-saveoursharecounts/</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: The buttons are not correctly being shown on my custom theme!</h4>
<p>
<p>A: Please make sure that wp_footer(); has been added to your theme. For more information please visit: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What is the external API feature?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: First of all: Usually you do not need it! The plugin requests all share counts itself. However, there are some reasons to put the backend on another server:<br />
&#8211; avoid requests from you WP server to all the social networks<br />
&#8211; use a more powerful server for the statistic<br />
&#8211; use the original backend implementation of Heise or your own solution<br />
&#8211; make your own backend available for more than one WP installation<br />
But please have in mind that there are also some good reasons not to use external servers:<br />
&#8211; you need an additional installation of WP and the plugin or have to create your own implementation of a Shariff backend<br />
&#8211; some plugin settings (backend checks, statistic, etc.) will only work on the external server<br />
&#8211; you have to use SHARIFF_FRONTENDS as an array with all your frontend domains to enable the backend or find your own solution<br />
&#8211; we CANNOT provide support for your own implementation</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: How can I configure the external API?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: In the statistic settings fill in the URL to the API of the external server. For the WordPress installation on the external server you have to create a &#8220;constant&#8221; called SHARIFF_FRONTENDS to permit other domains to use it. Please have in mind that you have to fill in all subdomains you want to use! The domains must be defined like this:<br />
    define( &#8216;SHARIFF_FRONTENDS&#8217;, &#8216;example.com|www.example.com|blog.example.com|another-domain.com&#8217; );</p>
</p>
<h4>Q: What does &#8220;Request external API directly.&#8221; mean?</h4>
<p>
<p>A: By default, the browser request the share counts from the server your site is running on. If you have entered an external API your server will then request the counts from this external API instead of fetching them itself. Therefore, the external server will only see the IP from your server and not the one from your visitors. If you check this option, the browser of your visitors will instead directly request the share counts from the external API and therefore reveal their IP address to them. This might be faster, but it is less secure. Please also make sure to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header right. If your site is available using https, your external API will need to be reached by https as well. Otherwise the request will get blocked for security reasons. All options and features (e.g. the ranking tab) regarding the statistic will only work on the external server.</p>
</p>
<h4>KNOWN BUGS</h4>
<p>
<p>These are bugs or unexpected glitches that we know of, but that do not have an impact on the majority of users, are not security relevant and will perhaps be fixed in the future &#8211; if we have time to spend or you provide us with a lot of &#8220;K&#xF6;lsch&#8221; 😉</p>
<ul>
<li>If the first post on the start page is password protected and Shariff is disabled on protected posts, a widget at the end of the loop will not be rendered.</li>

<p><strong>Hooks + Filters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use Custom Images Instead of Font Awesome Icons (New v1.1.6.7)</strong></p>
<p>Users can now use the custom announcement image in place of the font awesome icons by using the following filter. Huge thanks to <a href="https://petenelson.com/" rel="nofollow">Pete Nelson</a> for the pull request and making this possible and available for everyone.</p>
<p>Filter &#8211; timeline-express-custom-icon-html</p>
<p>Usage Example: https://gist.github.com/EvanHerman/6bbc8de82f34b4cb3c5c</p>
<p><strong>Use Alternate Image Size For Announcements (New v1.1.5.5)</strong></p>
<p>By default Timeline Express generates a custom image size to use within the timeline. If you would like to use another image size, you can use the following filter.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>function change_timeline_express_announcement_image_size( $image_size ) {
    $image_size = 'full';
    return $image_size;
}
add_filter( 'timeline-express-announcement-img-size' , 'change_timeline_express_announcement_image_size' );

<p><strong>Define your own custom fields to use in Announcement posts (New v1.1.5)</strong></p>
<p>Users can now add custom fields to Timeline Express announcement posts. This allows for greater control over the announcements and the front end display. Using this hook in conjunction with a custom single announcement template will give you the greatest control.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>function add_custom_timeline_express_field( $custom_fields ) {
    $custom_fields = array(
        array(
            'name' =&gt; __( 'Example Text Field', 'timeline-express' ),
            'desc' =&gt; __( 'this is an example user defined text field.', 'timeline-express' ),
            'id'   =&gt; 'announcement_user_defined_text',
            'type' =&gt; 'text_medium',
        ),
        array(
            'name' =&gt; __( 'Example WYSIWYG', 'timeline-express' ),
            'desc' =&gt; __( 'this is an example wysiwyg field.', 'timeline-express' ),
            'id'   =&gt; 'announcement_user_defined_wysiwyg',
            'type' =&gt; 'wysiwyg',
        ),
        array(
            'name' =&gt; __( 'Example Email Field', 'timeline-express' ),
            'desc' =&gt; __( 'this is an example user defined email field.', 'timeline-express' ),
            'id'   =&gt; 'announcement_user_defined_money',
            'type' =&gt; 'text_email',
        )
    );
    return $custom_fields;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_custom_fields' , 'add_custom_timeline_express_field' );
</code></pre>
<p>This example would add 3 new fields below the &#8216;Announcement Image&#8217; field on the announcement post.</p>
<p>The first field is a simple text field. The second field is an example WYSIWYG, and the third is an email field.</p>
<p>Note: You can add as many fields as you would like, and display them on the front end using the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta" title="WordPress Codex: get_post_meta()" rel="nofollow">get_post_meta()</a> function.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the &#8216;announcement&#8217; slug (New v1.1.4)</strong></p>
<p>Users can now define their own slug for announcement posts using the provided filter <code>'timeline-express-slug'</code>. This alters the URL structure of the announcement, possibly for SEO purposes. You would enter the following code into your active themes functions.php file.</p>
<p>After you enter the code into the functions.php file, you&#8217;ll want to refresh your permalinks. You can do so by going to &#8216;Settings &gt; Permalinks&#8217; and simply clicking save. That will prevent the 404 page you may see upon altering the slug.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>// alter '/announcement/' to be '/event/'
function timeline_express_change_announcement_slug( $slug ) {
    $slug = 'event';
    return $slug;
}
add_filter('timeline-express-slug', 'timeline_express_change_announcement_slug' );
</code></pre>
<p>This example would change the default <code>/announcement/</code> slug, to <code>/event/</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Alter the &#8216;Read More&#8217; button text (New v1.1.3.1)</strong></p>
<p>Users can now alter the &#8216;Read More&#8217; button text using the provided gettext filter and the &#8216;timeline-express&#8217; text domain.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>// alter 'Read more' to say 'View Announcement'
function timeline_express_change_readmore_text( $translated_text, $untranslated_text, $domain ) {
    switch( $untranslated_text ) {
        case 'Read more':
          $translated_text = __( 'View Announcement','timeline-express' );
        break;
     }
   return $translated_text;
}
add_filter('gettext', 'timeline_express_change_readmore_text', 20, 3);
</code></pre>
<p>This example would alter &#8216;Read more&#8217; to say &#8216;View Announcement&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Add custom classes to the &#8216;Read More&#8217; button (New v1.1.3.1)</strong></p>
<p>Users can now add custom classes to the &#8216;Read More&#8217; announcement button. This allows for greater control in fitting the Timeline into your currently active theme.</p>
<p>Parameters :</p>
<p>$button_classes = default button classes assigned to the &#8216;Read More&#8217; button</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>// add a custom class to the Timeline Express readmore link
function timeline_express_custom_readmore_class( $button_classes ) {
    return $button_classes . 'custom-class-name';
}
add_filter( 'timeline-express-read-more-class' , 'timeline_express_custom_readmore_class' );
</code></pre>
<p>This example would print the following &#8216;Read More&#8217; button HTML onto the page :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://site.com/link-to-announcement" class="cd-read-more btn btn-primary custom-class-name"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Setup a custom date format for front end display (New v1.0.9)</strong></p>
<p>New in version 1.0.9 is the localization of dates on the front end. The date format is now controlled by your date settings inside of &#8216;General &gt; Settings&#8217;.</p>
<p>If, for one reason or another, you&#8217;d like to specify a different date format than provided by WordPress core you can use the provided filter <code>timeline_express_custom_date_format</code>.</p>
<p>The one parameter you need to pass into your function is $date_format, which is (as it sounds) the format of the date.</p>
<p>Some formatting examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>m.d.Y</code> &#8211; 11.19.2014</li>
<li><code>d-m-y</code> &#8211; 11-19-14</li>
<li><code>d M y</code> &#8211; 19 Nov 2014</li>
<li><code>D j/n/Y</code> &#8211; Wed 11/19/2014</li>
<li><code>l jS \of\ F</code> &#8211; Wednesday 19th of November</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>function custom_te_date_format( $date_format ) {
    $date_format = "M d , Y"; // will print the date as Nov 19 , 2014
    return $date_format;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_custom_date_format' , 'custom_te_date_format' , 10 );
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>d &#8211; Numeric representation of a day, with leading zeros 01 through 31.</li>
<li>m &#8211; Numeric representation of a month, with leading zeros 01 through 12.</li>
<li>
<p>y &#8211; Numeric representation of a year, two digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D &#8211; Textual representation of a day, three letters Mon through Sun.</p>
</li>
<li>j &#8211; Numeric representation of a day, without leading zeros 1 through 31.</li>
<li>n &#8211; Numeric representation of a month, without leading zeros 1 through 12.</li>
<li>
<p>Y &#8211; Numeric representation of a year, four digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S &#8211; English ordinal suffix for the day of the month. Consist of 2 characters st, nd, rd or th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F &#8211; Textual representation of a month, January through December.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M &#8211; Textual representation of a month, three letters Jan through Dec.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Load Your Own Single Announcement Template File (New v1.0.8)</strong></p>
<p>By default all single announcements will try and load a single.php template file. If that can&#8217;t be found, we&#8217;ve done our best to implement a template for you. If your unhappy with the template file we&#8217;ve provided you have two options. Your first option is to copy over the single-announcement-template directory contained within the plugin into your active themes root. This will trigger the plugin to load that file instead. You can then customize this file to your hearts content without fear of losing any of your changes in the next update.</p>
<p>Your next option is to use our new filter for loading your own custom template file. If for whatever reason you&#8217;ve designed or developed your own single.php file which you would rather use, or you just want to use your themes page.php template instead, you can use the provided filter to change the loaded template. Here is an example ( you want to drop this code into your active theme&#8217;s functions.php file ) :</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>// By default Timeline Express uses single.php for announcements
// you can load page.php instead
// just change page.php to whatever your template file is named
// keep in mind, this is looking in your active themes root for the template
function custom_timeline_express_template_file( $template_file ) {
    $template_file = 'page.php';
    return $template_file;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_custom_template' , 'custom_timeline_express_template_file' , 10 );
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Specify Font Awesome Version (New 1.1.7.8)</strong></p>
<p>Users can now specify which version of font awesome to load from the font awesome CDN. Alternatively, if the font awesome version is not found &#8211; the bundled fall back (version 4.6.1) will be used.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>// use a different version of Font Awesome
function timeline_express_alter_font_awesome_version( $version ) {
    $version = '4.4.0';
    return $version;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_font_awesome_version', 'timeline_express_alter_font_awesome_version' );
</code></pre>
<p>The above example will load font awesome version 4.4.0 instead of the current stable version from the font awesome CDN.</p>
";s:12:"installation";s:1204:"<ol>

</ol>
";s:3:"faq";s:4207:"
<h4>Is there some demo I can checkout? I want to see how the plugin appears on the front end of a WordPress site before I install it.</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes! Check out the demo we&#8217;ve set up on our site, which shows off some of the features of the pro version.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wp-timelineexpress.com/examples/basic-timeline/" title="View the demo" rel="nofollow">View the Timeline Express Demo</a></p>
</p>
<h4>Can I filter announcements by categories/Can I create multiple timelines?</h4>
<p>
<p>Not in the free version, but with our pro version you can create numerous timelines and assign posts to a single timeline or all timelines. Also with the pro version you can easily filter announcements by categories on the front end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wp-timelineexpress.com/examples/filterable-timeline/" title="View the demo" rel="nofollow">View the Timeline Express Pro Demo</a></p>
</p>
<h4>How do I use this plugin?</h4>
<p>
<p>Begin by simply installing the plugin. Once the plugin has been installed, go ahead and begin creating announcement posts. You&#8217;ll find a new menu item just below &#8216;Posts&#8217;.<br />
After you have a substantial number of announcements set up, you&#8217;re ready to display the timeline on the front end of your site.</p>
<p>Timeline Express displays best on full width pages, but is not limited to them. Create a new page, and drop the shortcode into the page &#8211; <code>[timeline-express]</code>.<br />
Publish your page, and view it on the front end the see your new super sweet timeline! (scroll for animation effects!)</p>
</p>
<h4>What template is the single announcement post using? Can I customize it at all? I want to do x, y or z.</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes! In version 1.2 and above, we have a templating engine built into the plugin &#8211; allowing you to fully customize both the announcement containers on the timeline or the single announcement page. All you have to do is copy over the proper templates.</p>
<p>Take a look at our documentation articles on <a href="https://www.wp-timelineexpress.com/documentation/customize-announcement-container/" rel="nofollow">customizations</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Why can&#8217;t I save dates prior to &#8216;1970&#8217;?</h4>
<p>
<p>Due to a limitation with the built in php function <code>strtotime()</code>, you may not be able to save dates prior to 1970. We&#8217;ve built out a premium add-on that works with both the free and pro versions of Timeline Express to allow dates to be saved between the years 1000-9999. If this is a feature you need, please consider purchasing the <strong><a href="https://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-plugin/timeline-express-historical-dates-add-on/" rel="nofollow">Historical Dates Add-On</a></strong>.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I create more than one timeline?</h4>
<p>
<p>The free version limits you to one timeline. With the <a href="http://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-plugin/timeline-express/" title="Timeline Express Pro" rel="nofollow">pro version</a>, you can create unlimited number of timelines and even assign categories to your announcements.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I assign categories to my announcements?</h4>
<p>
<p>You can assign categories and filter your timelines by category with the <a href="http://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-plugin/timeline-express/" title="Timeline Express Pro" rel="nofollow">pro version</a> only.</p>
</p>
<h4>At what width are the breakpoints set?</h4>
<p>
<p>Breakpoints are set at 822px. The timeline will shift/re-adjust automatically based on the height of each announcement container.</p>
</p>
<h4>How can I translate this plugin?</h4>
<p>
<p>The text-domain for all gettext functions is <code>timeline-express</code>.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this plugin and want to contribute, we are always looking for people to help translate the plugin into their native language. Anyone who translates this plugin to 100% completion, will receive a single site license for Timeline Express Pro, valid for 1 full calendar year.</p>

remove and arrange the buttons that are shown on the Visual Editor toolbar. You can configure up to four rows of buttons including Font Sizes, Font Family, text and background colors, tables, etc. It will also let you enable the editor menu, see the <a href="screenshots" rel="nofollow">screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>It includes 15 plugins for <a href="https://tinymce.com/" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE</a> that are automatically enabled or disabled depending on the buttons you have chosen. In addition this plugin adds some commonly used options as keeping the paragraph tags in the Text editor and importing the CSS classes from the theme&#8217;s editor-style.css.</p>
<h4>Some of the features added by this plugin</h4>
<ul>
<li>Support for creating and editing tables.</li>
<li>More options when inserting lists.</li>
<li>Search and Replace in the editor.</li>
<li>Ability to set Font Family and Font Sizes.</li>
<li>And many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this plugin you can also enable the TinyMCE menu above the toolbars. This will make the editor even more powerful and convenient.</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>TinyMCE Advanced does not collect or store any user related data. It does not set cookies, and it does not connect to any third-party websites. It only uses functionality that is available in <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a>, and in the <a href="https://tinymce.com/" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE editor</a>.</p>
<p>In that terms TinyMCE Advanced does not affect your website&#8217;s user privacy in any way.</p>
";s:12:"installation";s:279:"<p>Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure that the plugin files are in a folder named &#8220;tinymce-advanced&#8221; (not two nested folders) in the WordPress plugins folder, usually &#8220;wp-content/plugins&#8221;.</p>
";s:3:"faq";s:2078:"
<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>
<p>Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure that the plugin files are in a folder named &#8220;tinymce-advanced&#8221; (not two nested folders) in the WordPress plugins folder, usually &#8220;wp-content/plugins&#8221;.</p>
</p>
<h4>No styles are imported in the Formats sub-menu.</h4>
<p>
<p>These styles are imported from your current theme editor-style.css file. However some themes do not have this functionality. For these themes TinyMCE Advanced has the option to let you add a customized editor-style.css and import it into the editor.</p>
</p>
<h4>I have just installed this plugin, but it does not do anything.</h4>
<p>
<p>Change some buttons on one of the toolbars, save your changes, clear your browser cache, and try again. If that does not work try reloding the Edit page several times while holding down Shift or Ctrl. There may also be a network cache somewhere between you and your host. You may need to wait for a few hours until this cache expires.</p>
</p>
<h4>When I add &#8220;Smilies&#8221;, they do not show in the editor.</h4>
<p>
<p>The &#8220;Emoticons&#8221; button in TinyMCE adds the codes for the smilies. The actual images are added by WordPress when viewing the Post. Make sure the checkbox &#8220;Convert emoticons to graphics on display&#8221; in &#8220;Options &#8211; Writing&#8221; is checked.</p>
</p>
<h4>The plugin does not add any buttons.</h4>
<p>
<p>Make sure the &#8220;Disable the visual editor when writing&#8221; checkbox under &#8220;Users &#8211; Your Profile&#8221; is <strong>not</strong> checked.</p>
</p>
<h4>I still see the &#8220;old&#8221; buttons in the editor</h4>
<p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Restore Default Settings&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and then set the buttons again and save.</p>
</p>

";s:12:"installation";s:2466:"<h4>General Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>First, you have to set up a running Matomo instance. You can get Matomo <a href="http://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and its documentation <a href="http://matomo.org/docs/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to update your Matomo instance, you should set your WordPress blog to maintenance while the update process is running.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Install WP-Matomo on a simple WordPress blog</h4>
<ol>
<li>Upload the full <code>wp-piwik</code> directory into your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>
<li>Open the new &#8216;Settings/WP-Matomo (WP-Piwik) Settings&#8217; menu and follow the instructions to configure your Matomo connection. Save settings.</li>
<li>If you have view access to multiple site stats and did not enable &#8220;auto config&#8221;, choose your blog and save settings again.</li>
<li>Look at &#8216;Dashboard/WP-Matomo (WP-Piwik)&#8217; to see your site stats.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Install WP-Matomo on a WordPress blog network (WPMU/WP multisite)</h4>
<p>There are two differents methods to use WP-Matomo in a multisite environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Site Specific Plugin it behaves like a plugin installed on a simple WordPress blog. Each user can enable, configure and use WP-Matomo on his own. Users can even use their own Matomo instances (and accordingly they have to). </li>
<li>Using WP-Matomo as a Network Plugin equates to a central approach. A single Matomo instance is used and the site admin configures the plugin completely. Users are just allowed to see their own statistics, site admins can see each blog&#8217;s stats.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Site Specific Plugin</em></p>
<p>Just add WP-Matomo to your /wp-content/plugins folder and enable the Plugins page for individual site administrators. Each user has to enable and configure WP-Matomo on his own if he want to use the plugin.</p>
<p><em>Network Plugin</em></p>
<p>The Network Plugin support is still experimental. Please test it on your own (e.g. using a local copy of your WP multisite) before you use it in an user context.</p>
<p>Add WP-Matomo to your /wp-content/plugins folder and enable it as <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network#WordPress_Plugins" rel="nofollow">Network Plugin</a>. Users can access their own statistics, site admins can access each blog&#8217;s statistics and the plugin&#8217;s configuration.</p>

</p>
<h4>Where can I find the Matomo URL and the Matomo auth token?</h4>
<p>
<p>To use this plugin you will need your own Matomo instance. If you do not already have a Matomo setup, you have two simple options: use either a <a href="http://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow">self-hosted Matomo</a> or <a href="https://www.innocraft.cloud/?pk_campaign=WP-Piwik" rel="nofollow">cloud-hosted Matomo by InnoCraft</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as Matomo works, you&#8217;ll be able to configure WP-Matomo: The Matomo URL is the same URL you use to access your Matomo, e.g. for the demo site: http://demo.matomo.org. The auth token is some kind of a secret password, which allows WP-Matomo to get the necessary data from Matomo. To get your auth token, log in to Matomo, click at the preferences gear icon (top right) and click at &#8220;API&#8221; (left sidebar menu, near the bottom).</p>
<p>You can get a more detailed description here: https://matomo.org/blog/2015/05/wordpress-integration-wp-piwik-1-0/</p>
</p>
<h4>I get this message: &#8220;WP-Matomo (WP-Piwik) was not able to connect to Matomo (Piwik) using our configuration&#8221;. How to proceed?</h4>
<p>
<p>First, please make sure your configuration is valid, e.g., if you are using the right Matomo URL (see description above). Then, go to the &#8220;Support&#8221; tab and run the test script. This test script will try to get some information from Matomo and shows the full response. Usually, the response output gives a clear hint what&#8217;s wrong:</p>
<p>The response output contains&#8230;<br />
* <strong>bool(false)</strong> and <strong>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</strong>: WP-Matomo is not allowed to connect to Matomo. Please check your Matomo server&#8217;s configuration. Maybe you are using a password protection via .htaccess or you are blocking requests from localhost/127.0.0.1. If you aren’t sure about this, please contact your web hoster for support.<br />
* <strong>bool(false)</strong> and <strong>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</strong>: The Matomo URL is wrong. Try to copy &amp; paste the URL you use to access Matomo itself via browser.<br />
* <strong>bool(false)</strong> and no further HTTP response code: The Matomo server does not respond. Very often, this is caused by firewall or mod_security settings. Check your server logfiles to get further information. If you aren’t sure about this, please contact your web hoster for support.</p>
</p>
<h4>PHP Compatibility Checker reports PHP7 compatbility issues with WP-Matomo.</h4>
<p>
<p>The Compatibility Checker shows two false positives. WP-Matomo is 100% PHP7 compatible, you can ignore the report.</p>
</p>
<h4>Overview shortcode shows no unique visitors using a yearly range.</h4>
<p>
<p>See <a href="http://matomo.org/faq/how-to/#faq_113" rel="nofollow">Matomo FAQ</a>.</p>
</p>
<h4>WP-Matomo only shows the first 100 sites of my multisite network. How can I get all other sites?</h4>
<p>
<p>The Matomo API is limited to 100 sites by default. Add the following line to the section [General] of Matomo&#8217;s config/config.ini.php file:</p>
<pre><code>API_datatable_default_limit = 1000
</code></pre>
</p>
<h4>Tracking does not work on HostGator!</h4>
<p>
<p>Try to enable the &#8220;avoid mod_security&#8221; option (WP-Matomo settings, Tracking tab) or create a mod_security whitelist.</p>
</p>
<h4>Can I contribute to WP-Matomo as a translator?</h4>
<p>
<p>You like to contribute to WP-Matomo translations? Please use the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-piwik/" rel="nofollow">Transifex translation community</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I will add missing languages if requested, and I will also upload the existing language files of older WP-Matomo releases.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t (or don not want to) use transifex, you can also translate languages/wp-piwik.pot delivered with WP-Matomo.</p>
<p>Thank you very much! 🙂</p>
